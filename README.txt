googlesitemap.common
====================

This core package includes sitemap generation common utilities with `sitemap indexes support`. 
This way you will be more Google-friendly and you will be able to use sitemaps with very large sites.

googlesitemap.common is not intended to be a standalone package. If you want to write a specific sitemap support you may start from here using its utilities.
