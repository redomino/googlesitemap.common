googlesitemap.common
====================

This core package includes sitemap generation common utilities with `sitemap indexes support`. 
This way you will be more Google-friendly and you will be able to use sitemaps with very large sites.

googlesitemap.common is not intended to be a standalone package. If you want to write a specific sitemap support you may start from here using its utilities.

For example this package is used by:

- googlesitemap.sitemap, standard sitemap with large sites support
- googlesitemap.news, sitemap that may help you to appear on GoogleNews
